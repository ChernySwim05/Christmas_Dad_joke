# Christmas Dad Joke Puzzle Game 🎄

A tiny browser-based Christmas game where you solve festive puzzles and unlock *gloriously terrible* dad jokes after each one. Finish all the puzzles to reveal a custom Merry Christmas message and an ASCII Christmas tree.

const tree =
  "         *\n" +
  "        /_\\n" +
  "       /_❄_\\n" +
  "      /_\\/_\\n" +
  "     /_❄_/_\\n" +
  "    /_\\/_\\/_\\n" +
  "       ||||\n" +
  "       ||||\n" +
  "    🎁  🎁  🎁";
```

Have fun, and may your code be bug-free and your dad jokes plentiful. 😄
